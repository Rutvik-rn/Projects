### Project 1: [Gallery Project]

**Description:** 

The HTML code represents a simple and clean web page structure for a "University Moments Gallery" project. The page includes a title, heading, and a visually appealing image gallery. Each image is accompanied by a descriptive caption, providing a glimpse into various university experiences. The use of containers and semantic HTML elements enhances the structure and readability of the code. 
The project aims to showcase key moments in the author's university journey through a well-organized and visually appealing gallery.
